*Abstract:*
Many accidents and incidents occur in one's day to day life like Gas leakage leading to explosions in Kitchens. The inflammable gas such as Liquidized petroleum gas (LPG), is commonly used in houses. It is clear that the major and most adapted way to ignite a gas stove is the LPG cylinders for cooking purposes. Major harm and other problems are caused, if gas leakage is not detected at the earliest. It is important to pay attention and treat gas leaks as emergencies. One must take immediate action to turn off the gas supply, ventilate the area, evacuate people and/or call a qualified gas engineer or emergency service for assistance. This is exactly why it is often said that whenever you notice the problem of leaking gas, do not ignore it. With our proposed system, GLAS - Gas leak Alert System, Kitchen automation is possible. Thus, when a gas leak is detected via the gas sensor of the system, it immediately alerts the user through a mobile application notification. The system is also programmed to send an SMS notification alerting those users with no Wi-Fi capabilities. At that very same instant, an alert is triggered at the residentâ€™s home by automatically turning on an alarm buzzer, a warning light, and the exhaust fan. GLAS provides safety and security to its users in dire situations relating to gas leak emergencies.
